# Car-Accidents-Excel-Project

This repository serves as a tool to showcase a personal data analytics project in which I analyze Car accidents between 2021 and 2022 to find insights.

I used this opportunity to delve deeply with different Excel features, where I cleaned, processed, analyzed, and visualized data using functions, pivot tables, slicers, visuals, etc. 

Out of the many insights I found the monthly casualties, total casualties by vehicle type, casualties by road surface, and much more.
